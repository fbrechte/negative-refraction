negative-refraction
===================

The page http://fbrechte.github.com/negative-refraction/ demonstrates the effect of negative refraction. Light rays are emitted by a point source S. The light rays impinge on a plate of material with negative refractive index n. At the two surfaces of the plate the light rays are refracted according to Snell's law.

The refractive index of the plate is negative (n<0). Materials with negative refractive index do not exist in nature, but there are attempts to produce such materials artificially.

With the help of the demonstration it can be seen that for n<0, a flat plate can focus light rays and that if n=-1, the image of the point source S is a point.
